# Tic Tac Toe

## Purpose
I'm going to make a simple game of tic tac toe to help teach myself some rust

### Phase 1
A simple CLI version, with a gameboard that you can use. It'll have two players that are manually controlled, show when someone has won and offer to keep score and let you start a new game when one is over
